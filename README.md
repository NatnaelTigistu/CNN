This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits (0â€“9).
Users can test the model in two ways:

Using the MNIST test dataset to measure accuracy.

Drawing digits manually (20 px, black on white in Paint or similar), then uploading the image for prediction.

This dual testing approach makes the project both a solid benchmark tool and an interactive application for real-world use.
